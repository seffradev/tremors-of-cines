# Pitch for The Tremors of Cines

There are pillars forming a heptagon. Each of which consist of a
different material to the previous, but all hold a metal plate
containing an inscription.

You're currently traversing a staircase to the platform the
heptagon enshrouds. As you reach the top you catch the span of
the landscape. There's a mountain rising hundreds of feet to the
east. Deep valleys to the south, carved by several rivers reaching
the vast ocean. The north carries a lush forest and the west scour
great plains.

The ground you're now standing on is an ancient stone platform,
embroidered by glyphs near every pillar, and three larger incisions
in the middle. At the south-east end stands a shaded man.

A glimmer is reflected onto one of the symbols as the sun sets.
With a faintly blowing west-wind, you stop. Reminded that your
hands are tied and two sturdy guards push you forward, you receive
the waking call that you're on the road to execution.

The dark-haired, tanned chieftain is following closely behind but,
as you and the guards grind to a halt, the cheiftain approaches the
shaded person and hands over a piece of cloth with what looks like
blood.

You can now discern the shaded man. It's the clan's shaman.
Equipped with alchemy tools, several bags of powders and a necklace
of nickel, they nod to the chieftain and point to the sun.

The glimmer has moved closer to the center. It must be reflected by
the setting star. Just minutes from dusk the now-apparent shaman
initiates an indiscernible chant. Having caressed a sharpened
tungsten sword with the cloth, dipped in a bag of charcoal, they
hand the sword over to one of the guards.

The second guard force your neck down. Locked hands you feel almost
powerless. As you sense your imminent doom you notice a shimmer in
the calming twilight sky. It's a falling star.

You believe they're conducting a ritual that requires the last
light of the last autumn day. Sadly that's today. Dusk has not yet
fallen upon you. There is still time to stop the execution and
break free. At least they didn't constrain your legs, and you are
free to talk. The reflection is ever closer to the center.

The shaman flicks his wrist, the chieftain strikes a praying pose
and you hear the sword swing towards your bent-down neck. Your time
has come. As you feel the sword piercing your neck, it suddenly
freezes in place when a booming voice echoes over the landscape.

"Wrong!"
"Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!"
"You're not supposed to be apathetic. Guys, we have another faulty
one. Rebalance the weights, Harvey reset the-" and the voice cuts
out.

You wake up in a forest.
